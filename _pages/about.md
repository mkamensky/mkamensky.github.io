I am a lecturer (assistant professor) at the [Math 
department](https://www.math.bgu.ac.il) of [Ben-Gurion 
University](https://www.bgu.ac.il), Be'er-Sheva, Israel.

I received my PhD in 2007 from the Hebrew University, under the supervision 
of [Ehud Hrushovski](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehud/). Previous positions 
include:

- Postdoc at the [Mathematics department](http://math.huji.ac.il) 
  of [The Hebrew University](http://www.huji.ac.il) in Jerusalem, Israel, 
  working with [Ehud Hrushovski](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehud/).

- Postdoc at the [Mathematics department](https://math.nd.edu) 
  of [Notre-Dame University](https://www.nd.edu), where I worked with [Sergei 
  Starchenko](https://www.nd.edu/~sstarche), as well as others in the [logic 
  group](https://math.nd.edu/research/research-groups-in-mathematics/logic)

- Postdoc at the [Pure Math 
  department](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/PM_Dept/) of the [University of 
  Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). I worked there with [Rahim 
  Moosa](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rmoosa).

East-Anglia](http://www.uea.ac.uk), where I worked with [David 
Evans](http://www.mth.uea.ac.uk/~h120).


## Research interests
I am interested in model theory (a branch of mathematical logic), and its 
interactions with other areas of mathematics, especially algebraic geometry, 
representation theory, differential equations and category theory.
