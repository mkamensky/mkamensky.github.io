## Abstract
The course provides an introduction to the theory of non-commutative rings, and related structures. We will take as our motivating goal understanding the representation theory of finite groups. This will lead us to study the structure of *semisimple* rings, which is well understood due to a number of theorems by Wedderburn.

After drawing conclusions for representation theory, we will study in more details the building blocks in Wedderburn's theory, namely, *division rings* and rings of matrices over them. This has applications in geometry and number theory, which we will try to outline.

Further topics will vary depending on the time constraints and the taste of the audience, but may include further study of group representations, more general classes of rings (non semisimple, non Artinian) and localisation. Whenever possible, we will try to include applications and relations to other fields.

**Background required**: A reasonable understand of linear algebra and basic Galois theory. Familiarity with the basic notions in commutative algebra and category theory is desirable, but not required (missing material will be reviewed as needed).
