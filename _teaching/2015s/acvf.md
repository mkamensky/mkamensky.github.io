A valued field is an algebraic object that plays a role analogous to that of 
a ``small disc around 0'' in geometry. In this course we will focus on the 
model theory of such fields, and its uses. The course will begin with a 
review of basic results on the first order theory of algebraically closed 
valued fields, such as quantifier elimination and structure of sets definable 
in one variable. We will the discuss elimination of imaginaries, integration 
theory, stable domination and the structure of the type space, and the 
analogy with Berkovich spaces.
