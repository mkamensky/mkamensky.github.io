collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Model-theory-of-fields-with-free-operators-in-positive-characteristic
excerpt: We give algebraic conditions about a finite algebra B over a perfect field of positive characteristic, which are equivalent to the companionability of the theory of fields with "B-operators" (i.e. the operators coming from homomorphisms into tensor products with B). We show that, in the most interesting case of a local B, these model companions admit quantifier elimination in the "smallest possible" language and they are strictly stable. We also describe the forking relation there.
