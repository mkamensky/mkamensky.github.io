excerpt: "We give algebraic conditions about a finite algebra B over a perfect field of positive characteristic, which are equivalent to the companionability of the theory of fields with \"B-operators\" (i.e. the operators coming from homomorphisms into tensor products with B). We show that, in the most interesting case of a local B, these model companions admit quantifier elimination in the \"smallest possible\" language and they are strictly stable. We also describe the forking relation there."

We give algebraic conditions about a finite algebra B over a perfect field of positive characteristic, which are equivalent to the companionability of the theory of fields with &quot;B-operators&quot; (i.e. the operators coming from homomorphisms into tensor products with B). We show that, in the most interesting case of a local B, these model companions admit quantifier elimination in the &quot;smallest possible&quot; language and they are strictly stable. We also describe the forking relation there.
