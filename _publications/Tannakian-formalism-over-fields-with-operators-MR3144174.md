permalink: "/publication/Tannakian-formalism-over-fields-with-operators-MR3144174"
excerpt: "We develop a theory of tensor categories over a field endowed with abstract operators. Our notion of a \"field with operators\", coming from work of Moosa and Scanlon, includes the familiar cases of differential and difference fields, Hasse-Schmidt derivations, and their combinations. We develop a corresponding Tannakian formalism, describing the category of representations of linear groups defined over such fields. The paper extends the previously know (classical) algebraic and differential algebraic Tannakian formalisms."

We develop a theory of tensor categories over a field endowed with abstract operators. Our notion of a &quot;field with operators&quot;, coming from work of Moosa and Scanlon, includes the familiar cases of differential and difference fields, Hasse-Schmidt derivations, and their combinations. We develop a corresponding Tannakian formalism, describing the category of representations of linear groups defined over such fields. The paper extends the previously know (classical) algebraic and differential algebraic Tannakian formalisms.
