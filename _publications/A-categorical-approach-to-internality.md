excerpt: "Model theoretic internality provides conditions under which the group of automorphisms of a model over a reduct is itself a definable group. In this paper we formulate a categorical analogue of the condition of internality, and prove an analogous result on the categorical level. The model theoretic statement is recovered by considering the category of definable sets."

Model theoretic internality provides conditions under which the group of automorphisms of a model over a reduct is itself a definable group. In this paper we formulate a categorical analogue of the condition of internality, and prove an analogous result on the categorical level. The model theoretic statement is recovered by considering the category of definable sets.
